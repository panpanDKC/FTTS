# FTTS

## Introduction

FTTS (Fast Typing Training Software) is an application where you can train your typing **speed** and **accuracy**.
It use Markov chains to generate (almost) meaningful text with punctuations and caps.

There are two modes : *Normal* and *Time*. In *Normal* mode, you will choose the number of word to write and try to write as fast as you can.

In *Time* mode, you'll have to write as many words as you can before you run out of time.

When FTTS is launched, you just need to start typing what you read and the training begins !

## Shortcuts
FTTS is meant to be used only with keyboard, so navigation between option is made with key sequences :

- **Shift + Enter** : Prepare a new training
- **Shift + Backspace** : Change game mode
- **Cmd + Shift + R** : Reset overall statistics
- **Left and Right arrow keys** : Select game length (depends on the game mode)
